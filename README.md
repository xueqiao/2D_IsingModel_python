# 2D_IsingModel_python
Here includes a .py file to visualize the 2D Ising Model. I built it when Metropolis Algorithm is taught in the  <Thermal Physics>. The textbook is 'AN INTRODUCTION TO THERMAL PHYSICS' by Daniel V.Schroeder.

You can set the size of lattice and the equilibrium temperature in .py.

I also upload a result of a 400x400 lattice at T=2.37k as a sample.
